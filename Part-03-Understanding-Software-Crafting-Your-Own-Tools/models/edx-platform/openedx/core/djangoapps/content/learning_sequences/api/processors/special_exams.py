"""
As currently designed, this processor ignores the course specific
`Enable Timed Exams` setting when determining whether or not it should
remove keys and/or supplement exam data. This matches the exact behavior
of `MilestonesAndSpecialExamsTransformer`. It is not entirely clear if
the behavior should be modified, so it has been decided to consider any
necessary fixes in a new ticket.

Please see the PR and discussion linked below for further context
