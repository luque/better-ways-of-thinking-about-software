# Packages to install in the Python sandbox for secured execution of code provided by course authors.
#
# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files

# We pin things specifically in this file beacuse we want to be very explicit about
# updating dependencies to the sandbox since they can impact how custom response code is run.
# We can then use constraints.txt to constrain any sub-dependencies that may need to be held back.
